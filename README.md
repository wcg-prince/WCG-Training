Practice of Github

- Check for the git version
- Setup username and email to git configuration
- Go to the directory of the last task
- let's assume the last directory name is "User Management"
- Init Git
- Create branch “user-management” (according to your project name)
- Add ".gitignore" file
- In that file include all the unwanted directories or files that are not supposed to be in the repository
- Ex: .env, node_modules, secret files
- Make sure you do not push any secret key or password to the repository it could lead to a security breach
- Check the file using the status command
- Now stage files and check the status again
- Add a commit message and push your code to the branch
- Check the log on the local repository, and match the commit ID with the remote repository.
- Create a 2nd from your branch on GitHub, fetch the branch in locally, and checkout.
- Create a 3rd new branch from the 1st branch and push to the remote
